This was an online course on the NPTEL platform made by Prof. Sudharshan Iyenger from IIT Ropar.
This repository contains all the programs, weekly assignments that I have learnt in the NPTEL course on Joy of Computing using Python.
It was an 8 week online course. After 8 weeks I have appeared for NPTEL Online Certification exam and secured 84%.
This course contains the basics of python such as list, tuples, dictionary, searching, sorting and some amazing games.
One of the best course on NPTEL platform to start with Python programming.
